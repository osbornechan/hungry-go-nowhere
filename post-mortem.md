# Approach and Process
## What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
Deploy early on Heroku. Take the time to learn React components instead of wasting time on repeating codes across pages.

## What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
Breaking down a bigger functionality into smaller parts, and testing each part

# Code and Code Design
## What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
Definitely start with both a grand 'idea' and a scaled down version, then plan ERD/app design accordingly to ensure it can be scaled up. Implementing components in the app. Including sorting functionality. 

## What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
Took the time to redo my ERD diagram, which was a huge asset throughout the development process.

## For each, please include code examples.

Code snippet up to 20 lines.
Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.
(Refer to README.md for ERD)

# WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem
## What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
Setting minimum achieveables per day for each part of the project.

## What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
Did not think of doing things beyond the scope of the project/ what I have already learnt, hence not really improving much.

## How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
It's getting tougher, since it's covering new topics outside of the pre-work, so I need a lot more time to digest and content. Course materials also tend to be more 'directional' than 'informative', so it points more to where to find detailed information.
