## Background
Getting prepared for COVID circuit breaker comes down to one basic thing - <strong>Food</strong>.<br/>
Or toilet paper evidently, but really that only becomes a concern once you have had some food, if you think about it.
(Okay, maybe don't think about it.)

We gotta eat. And more often than not, we are going to need to know what's in our kitchens to prepare these meals.

## Problem
It is difficult to keep track of what food items are currently in our kitchen (inventory), and what groceries are being delivered to us from various supermarkets, at what time.

## Solution
An app to keep track of current food inventory, arriving food items as well as delivery time.
